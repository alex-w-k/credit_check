## Getting Started
---
### Big picture
I need to successfully check a single given credit card number that is hard coded using the Luhn algorithm, then I need to check then I need to check an inputted credit card number for validity.

### Interface
The interface will be the terminal

### Smaller Problems

1. I need to first reverse the card number
2. Then I need to get each number individually
3. Once I have these split, then I need to double every other number
4. Then I need to add all of the doubled numbers and the unchanged numbers
5. Then i need to modulo the sum and check if it's zero

### How do we get there?
